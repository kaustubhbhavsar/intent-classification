<!-- ABOUT PROJECT -->
## What Is It?
<div align="center">

    HARRY: Ron, please play 'Tere Naina'...
    RON: Ummm.. Okay.. Playing 'Tere Naina'...
    
</div>

Question is - how did Ron completed the task here? Roughly, he first found the intent of the task, i.e., what needs to be done? Here, intent was 'PlayMusic'. So, Ron thus started a music app and played the above mentioned song.

Now, how about automatically finding out the intent of the user? How about finding what the user intents to do, and responding likewise at earliest thus keeping the user sticking around the app? A win-win situation for both the user and the app creator.

Intent classification is the task of classifying the text into one of the many intents (multiclass-classification).

> <b>Aim of the project is to perform multiclass intent classification (and also subtask: topic modelling).</b>

<!-- Final Notes -->
## Final Notes
To run the entire project use JupyterLab or similar IDE.

Notebooks can also be run directly on google colab (make sure to upload required .py files in working directory if required).

To run the flask script:
```
$ python helper_text_preprocessing.py
```

> NOTE: Notebooks may use python scripts to run.
